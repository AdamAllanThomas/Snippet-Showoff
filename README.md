# Snippet-Showoff
A few code snippets to show off some of the work I have done.

### isPersonalBest

This TypeScript function, isPersonalBest, highlights my ability to write clean, concise, and readable code that follows good software design principles. The function demonstrates my proficiency in TypeScript, using types for function arguments and return values to ensure type safety. It also clearly exhibits the Single Responsibility Principle as it is focused on determining whether a logged set is a new personal best for weight, one-repetition maximum (1RM), or volume.

The logic within the function shows how I handle calculations and conditional checks. It checks against the current set summary (if available), and calculates the 1RM and volume for comparison, showcasing my problem-solving skills and attention to detail.

The code is also properly documented with comments that describe its functionality, enhancing readability and understanding for other developers. This approach reflects my commitment to effective communication in code and highlights how I design functions with maintainability and collaboration in mind.
